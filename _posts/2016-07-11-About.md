### Kim, Ki Hyun

Hi, this is Ki. I am currently Machine Learning Engineer at [Ticketmonster](http://www.ticketmonster.co.kr/) aka TMON. 
I am developing (Personalized) Recommender System for TMON using Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

Previously, I was a researcher at [ETRI](https://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri) and I developed Automatic Speech Recognition System for mobile, which is called [GenieTalk](https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/jinitog-genietalk/id1104930501?mt=8).
I took a charge of Language Modeling(LM), NLP and NLU for ASR system.

I love to study and solve a problem from sparse data like NLP and Recommendation.
If you need further info, please, refer my [resume]({{ site.baseurl }}/resume_ki.pdf).

Thanks.
